To show how Minxent handles different types of bias in the expert maps, we sought to determine whether unbiased presences could overcome problems introduced by the expert map. Evaluation statistics (AUC, shown inset) was based on the presences used for fitting and either 5441 observed absences ($AUC^abs$) or 10,000 random background points ($AUC^bg$). Across all tests, Minxent generally captured the full distribution even when presence points were completely lacking.  In general, the presences were sufficient to identify higher suitability regions outside the biased expert map, even though these regions had much lower probability than those inside the biased expert map. As these tests represent rather extreme bias, it is encouraging that Minxent can still distinguish portions of the range outside the biased expert maps.
