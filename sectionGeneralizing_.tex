\section{Generalizing to other species}%----------------------


\begin{enumerate}
  \item tinamou: show how  the smoother expert map improves over a step functions
  \item harvest mouse: disjoint distribution
  \item Congo peacock example: showing how to combine priors (forest?)
  \item lela with forest as an extra layer?
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{How are predictions affected by different range geometry?} 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item decay shape important for skinny ranges?
  \item connect to fig 2, and which panels are NA
\end{enumerate}
