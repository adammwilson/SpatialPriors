To show how Minxent handles different types of bias in the presence data, we sought to determine whether including the expert map was sufficient to overcome a lack of presences in some regions. That is, if the expert maps suggests a presence, but no point data are observed there, what will Minxent predict? Evaluation statistics (AUC, shown inset) was based on the presences used for fitting and either 5441 observed absences ($AUC^abs$) or 10,000 random background points ($AUC^bg$).  Across all tests, Minxent generally captured the full distribution even when presence points were completely lacking. In all cases, Minxent performed the same or better than Maxent with the same set of biased presences.
