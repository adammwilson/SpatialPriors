To test how Minxent handles biased presences in conjunction with a reasonably accurate expert map, we sequentially omitted parts of the presence data set: points in both the north and south (first row); points in the center of the range (second row); southern-most points (third row); northern-most points (fourth row). The presence points used for fitting each model are shown as black '+'. The expert map is outlined in black.
