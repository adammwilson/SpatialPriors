Comparison of various offsets and the resulting predicted relative occupance rates.  a. Maps of predictions for four offsets ranging from flat (Rate=0) to a step function (Rate=10).  b.  Offset and predictions along transect (along dark line in a).   An illusutration of the importance of smoothing the expert maps. If a step function is used (a) equal prior probability is assigned to cells addict to the expert boundary and cells many thousands of km away. This assumption is unrealistic because expert errors or dispersal are most likely closer to the expert boundary. By smoothing expert boundaries, we can remove spurious predictions far from the known distributtion (c?) (base on the critical assumption that the expert maps are already reasonably accurate).
