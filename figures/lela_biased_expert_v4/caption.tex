 To test how Minxent handles biased expert maps in conjunction with reasonably accurate presences, we sequentially omitted parts of the expert map: long thin blob in the center (first row); four northern-most blobs (second row); one southern-most blob (third row).  The presence points used for fitting each model are shown as black '+'. The expert map is outlined in black.
