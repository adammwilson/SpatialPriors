Mapped predictions for different smoothing parameters applied to the expert range map. Columns show different levels of expert accuracy while rows show different combinations of rate (larger=steeper), skew(larger=softer edge inside the expert boundary), and outside distance (beyond expert range boundary which contributes to the user-defined \% in (need a better name) parameters. %Panels with NA values could not achieve the desired \% in due to mutually inconsistent combinations of parameters; the highest achievable \% in is shown.
